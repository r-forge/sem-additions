Dear Andrea,
I think the model fit retrospective power analysis with the Satorra and Saris (1985) can be implemented in LISREL as follows:
    i) Specify an alternative model, say Ma, which represents a plausible theoretical alternative to your target model Mt.
    ii) Run LISREL for Mt with the real data covariance matrix.
    iii) Obtain the implied covariance matrix, say Mt.SIG, and the chi square value, say Ft.
    iv) Rerun LISREL for Ma with covariance Matrix equal to Mt.SIG.
    v) Obtain the chi square value Fa and the number of degrees of freedom DFa.
    vi) Calculate the chi square difference between Fa and Ft, say deltaF. This difference estimates the noncentrality     parameter (ncp).
    vii) Consult a table of noncentral chi-square to obtain estimated power for the ncp with DFa degrees of freedom.
Best Regards.
Haykel Demnati
